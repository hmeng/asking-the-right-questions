# Chapter 3: Leadership Questions

> "The art of leadership is not to spend your time measuring, evaluating. It's all about selecting the person. And if you believe you selected the right person, then you give that person the freedom, the authority, to implement your vision." — Jack Welch

Leadership is fundamentally about influence—the ability to guide, inspire, and empower others toward a shared purpose. While traditional views of leadership emphasize having the right answers, truly exceptional leaders distinguish themselves through the questions they ask. This chapter explores how thoughtful questioning can transform your leadership effectiveness.

## Questions that Inspire and Motivate

Great leaders use questions to ignite purpose and passion rather than simply issuing directives.

**Essential Questions:**
1. "What impact do you hope to make through this work?"
2. "What part of this project energizes you the most?"
3. "How do you see this connecting to our larger purpose?"
4. "What would make this work meaningful for you?"
5. "What would extraordinary success look like?"

**Example in Practice:**

When launching a critical project, Marcus, a technology director, could have simply assigned tasks and deadlines. Instead, he began by asking each team member, "What aspect of this project would give you the greatest sense of contribution if you were able to shape it?" This question shifted the conversation from compliance to commitment. Team members identified components they felt personally invested in, leading to greater ownership and creative problem-solving throughout the project. The initiative was delivered ahead of schedule with several innovations that weren't in the original plan.

**Application Exercise:**
Before your next team meeting, prepare three questions designed to connect team members' personal values and interests to the work at hand. Ask these questions before discussing specific tasks or timelines, and notice how the energy in the conversation shifts.

## Questions for Effective Delegation

The art of delegation lies not in simply assigning tasks but in creating clarity and ownership through thoughtful questioning.

**Essential Questions:**
1. "What support do you need to be successful with this?"
2. "How would you approach this challenge?"
3. "What obstacles do you anticipate, and how might you overcome them?"
4. "How will you know if you're on track?"
5. "What authority do you need to make decisions about this work?"

**Example in Practice:**

Lisa, a hospital administrator, needed to delegate the implementation of a new patient intake process. Rather than providing detailed instructions, she asked her team lead, "How would you approach redesigning this process if you were in my position?" This question invited strategic thinking rather than just execution. The team lead proposed an approach that incorporated perspectives Lisa hadn't considered. When challenges arose during implementation, the team lead felt empowered to make adjustments without constant approval, resulting in a more efficient solution than Lisa had initially envisioned.

**Application Exercise:**
Identify a task you need to delegate this week. Write down five questions you'll ask to ensure the person feels both challenged and supported. Focus on questions that clarify outcomes while leaving room for the person's own approach and creativity.

## Questions for Coaching and Developing Others

Effective leaders accelerate growth through questions that promote self-discovery rather than through advice-giving.

**Essential Questions:**
1. "What have you learned from this situation so far?"
2. "What options are you considering, and what are the pros and cons of each?"
3. "What would you do if you knew you couldn't fail?"
4. "What skills would you like to develop through this experience?"
5. "What's one thing you might try that you haven't considered yet?"

**Example in Practice:**

James, an experienced engineering manager, was mentoring a promising but self-critical junior engineer. When the engineer encountered a challenging technical problem, rather than solving it for her, James asked, "What approaches have you considered, and what might you try next?" This question communicated confidence in her problem-solving abilities while providing an opportunity to discuss her thinking process. Through this questioning approach repeated over several months, the engineer developed not just technical skills but also the confidence to tackle increasingly complex challenges independently.

**Application Exercise:**
During your next coaching conversation, commit to asking at least three questions for every piece of advice you give. Notice how this shift affects the other person's engagement and ownership of solutions.

## Questions for Building Trust

Trust forms the foundation of effective leadership, and the right questions can significantly strengthen this foundation.

**Essential Questions:**
1. "What would make our working relationship more effective for you?"
2. "What do you need from me that you're not getting?"
3. "How would you prefer to receive feedback?"
4. "What am I missing or not seeing from your perspective?"
5. "What's something I could do differently that would better support your success?"

**Example in Practice:**

When Priya took over leadership of a team with low morale, she began one-on-one meetings by asking, "What has made you stay with this team despite the challenges?" and "What would need to change for this to feel like a place where you can do your best work?" These questions demonstrated that she valued team members' perspectives and was committed to improvement. The honest conversations that followed revealed specific issues that previous leaders had missed, allowing Priya to address root causes rather than symptoms. Within six months, team retention improved by 40% and productivity metrics showed significant gains.

**Application Exercise:**
Schedule brief trust-building conversations with three key stakeholders. In each conversation, ask questions about how you can better support them and what might strengthen your working relationship. Take notes and follow through on at least one insight from each conversation.

## Questions for Navigating Difficult Conversations

Leaders regularly face challenging conversations about performance, conflict, or change. The right questions can transform these moments from confrontational to collaborative.

**Essential Questions:**
1. "I've noticed [specific observation]. Can you help me understand what's happening from your perspective?"
2. "What do you think is contributing to this situation?"
3. "What's important to you in resolving this issue?"
4. "What part of this situation might I be contributing to?"
5. "What would a good outcome look like for both of us?"

**Example in Practice:**

Robert needed to address declining performance with a previously high-performing team member. Instead of leading with criticism, he opened with, "I've noticed changes in your work recently compared to your usual high standards. I'm concerned and wondering what might be going on for you?" This question created space for the team member to share that he was dealing with a family health crisis. Instead of a disciplinary conversation, the discussion shifted to temporary accommodations and support. The performance issues resolved once the personal situation stabilized, and the team member's loyalty increased due to the compassionate approach.

**Application Exercise:**
Before your next difficult conversation, write down three open-ended, non-judgmental questions that invite the other person to share their perspective before you present your concerns or conclusions.

## Case Study: How Great Leaders Ask Better Questions

**Alan Mulally's Turnaround of Ford Motor Company**

When Alan Mulally became CEO of Ford in 2006, the company was losing billions and heading toward potential bankruptcy. One of his first and most influential actions was to transform how leadership team meetings were conducted—not through directives, but through questions.

Mulally instituted a weekly Business Plan Review meeting where each executive was expected to report on their area using a simple color code: green for on plan, yellow for issues requiring attention, and red for serious problems.

In early meetings, despite the company's dire situation, executives only reported green statuses—no one wanted to bring bad news. In one pivotal meeting, Mark Fields, a senior executive, reported a red status involving a production delay for a key vehicle launch.

Instead of criticism, Mulally asked, "What can we do to help?" and followed with, "Does anyone have suggestions to help Mark with this issue?"

This simple question sequence—acknowledging the problem and focusing on collaborative solutions rather than blame—transformed Ford's leadership culture. Within weeks, executives were openly reporting issues and collaboratively solving problems.

Mulally continued using questions to challenge established thinking:
- "Why do we accept that we can't be profitable in the small car segment?"
- "What if we had one global Ford with shared platforms instead of regional fiefdoms?"
- "How might we simplify our product lineup to better serve what customers truly value?"

His questioning approach led to the "One Ford" strategy that streamlined operations, reduced costs, and created a more cohesive global organization. By 2009, while competitors required government bailouts, Ford returned to profitability. By the time Mulally retired in 2014, Ford's stock price had increased more than 10-fold.

**The Lesson:**

Mulally demonstrated that asking the right questions can transform not just conversations but entire organizational cultures. By creating psychological safety for truthful answers and focusing questions on collective problem-solving rather than individual blame, he enabled the candor and collaboration necessary for Ford's historic turnaround.

## Chapter Summary: Leadership Question Framework

Exceptional leadership questioning follows a distinct pattern:

1. **Purpose-Connecting Questions:** Link individual work to meaningful impact
2. **Clarity-Creating Questions:** Ensure shared understanding of expectations
3. **Capability-Building Questions:** Foster growth through guided discovery
4. **Relationship-Strengthening Questions:** Build trust through genuine curiosity
5. **Problem-Solving Questions:** Address challenges through collaborative exploration

This framework shifts leadership from a directive approach ("Here's what you should do") to an inquiring approach ("What do you think we should do?"), unlocking the collective intelligence and commitment of the team.

**Five Questions to Transform Your Leadership:**
1. "What matters most right now, and why?"
2. "What do you think we should do, and what support would you need?"
3. "What might we be missing or overlooking?"
4. "How can I be most helpful to you right now?"
5. "What have we learned, and what will we do differently next time?"

In the next chapter, we'll explore how questions can accelerate personal growth, helping you break through limitations, develop better habits, and find deeper purpose and meaning.
